# A3UE-Variant-SCP
An Extender mod for Arma 3 Antistasi Ultimate, This adds a number of Factions, Rebels, and Rivals based on the SCP Universe and the MTF Epsilon-4 Arma 3 Unit's storyline.
THIS IS AN EARLY RELEASE FOR TESTING. THIS IS NOT FINISHED.

A number of factions from the SCP Universe, recreated for use in Antistasi Ultimate.
Because of the 'covert' nature of the SCP universe, most of these factions are supported by armies from allied nations.

These factions are NOT accurate to depictions from lore. They were recreated for use within my unit and make sense only in its canon.

Most factions only expose their direct operatives at SF or Elite levels, meaning Police, Militia, and Military tiers will be represented by soldiers of their supporting nation. Example: Police, Militia, and Military for FBI UIU are US Army and Marines. Elite and SF forces wear FBI HRT gear.

Tiers of soldiers were designed with gameplay in mind, with each tier using slightly different equipment than the previous tier. This should allow for more equipment to steal, as well as each tier being slightly more difficult to face, instead of all tiers becoming easy once you have stolen enough equipment. (THIS ALSO MEANS THAT HIGHER TIERS MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT IN ORDER TO KEEP UP THE DIFFICULTY CURVE. ESPECIALLY GRU-P)

Mod requirements may not be fully accurate.
It is also HIGHLY recommended to own the Contact & Apex DLCs

Want to complain that something doesn't fit into lore? Alt+F4 opens a direct chat with my complaint server. I will respond to all complaints that arrive there.

Are you interested in playing Story-Based Operations with these factions? Do you want to play Antistasi with the guys responsible for this? Would you like another discord server to add to your list of servers you don't use?
